# Prediction of Wind Fence placement for building wind by CFD based Artificial intelligence in a Applied Fluid Dynamics Course, Yonsei University

### Introdiction

The increasing trend of skyscraper construction and higher urban density has led to the recognition of building-induced wind as a new hazard. This study focuses on "wind fences" as a solution to mitigate building-induced wind. By leveraging Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data, AI models are trained to provide optimal wind fence positions quickly, omitting the time and cost-intensive CFD analysis process. 
These solutions can be easily and rapidly applied in the building design phase, presented in the form of Augmented Reality (AR) solutions.
